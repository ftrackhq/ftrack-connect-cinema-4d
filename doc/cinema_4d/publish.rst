Publish your work
*****************

The publish feature lets you publish your work to ftrack so that it can be
handed over to someone else or imported into another application.

Publishing in Cinema 4D will publish the active project as a copy so that you
can continue working on your local copy. The project's preview image will be
used as the version's thumbnail.

More information about publishing media can be found :ref:`here. <using/publish>`
